# C# SharpMTKClient, mtk chipset protocol
# About Source code
SharpMTKClient is GUI written with c# by alephgsm team for mediatek chipset devices, codes of this project are updated more often than bkerler/mtkclient and some forensic tools, but with continuous tests, we will fix some bugs. Also, this project is raw C# code and has no dependency on python, usbdk, etc.

SharpMTKClient also will support MTK V6 XML type device, you can see screenshots following screenshot list

usb protocol is based on windows api(kernel32) (No dependency on usbdk), we used libusb just for SLA bypass function

tested on 1000+ more device like xiomi, oppo , samsung , huawei, etc and all features will work w/o bugs
